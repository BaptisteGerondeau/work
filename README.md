## My main work directory

This is my main work directory. It means that I spend basically all my day inside this directory, digging for upstream patches, investigating functional tests regressions, developing new tests, backporting fixes, reading source codes, etc. 

I'm using git submodules to manage all the source codes I usually need in my day-by-day, and this is the main work directory containing all the submodules AND the scripts I usually use to manage my workflow. It is no quantum physics, but it is, for sure, pragmatic and helps a lot.

This is also an attempt of trying to automate a quick way of replicating my working environment inside my devel and build machines and inside the boards I have in my lab. My idea is to provide, soon, instructions on how to clone this structure and use it for your own needs if you find it interesting.
